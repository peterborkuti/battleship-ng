# BattleshipNg

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.2.

# Play

You can play with this game [here](https://peterborkuti.github.io/battleship-ng/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng build --prod --base-href='https://peterborkuti.github.io/battleship-ng/'` than
`ngh`. This will push gh-pages branch onto GitHub. You need to install angular-cli-ghpages for this to work. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

I made tests without karma. Install jasmine-ts and `npm test`. Tests for pure js classes are in the spec folder.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
